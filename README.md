# PYPELINE
A data pipeline manager. 

The microservice allows users to create, schedule, and monitor data pipelines for tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading. 

Users create new pipelines to extract data from a specific source, transform the data using and loading the data into a cloud storage.

The pipeline manager handles scheduling the tasks, ensuring that they run at the specified times, and monitoring the status of each task.
