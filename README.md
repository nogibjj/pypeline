A data pipeline manager. 

The microservice allows users to create and monitor data pipelines for tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading. 

Users create new pipelines to extract data from a specific source, transform the data using and loading the data into a cloud storage.

The pipeline manager handles scheduling the tasks, ensuring that they run at the specified times, and monitoring the status of each task.
